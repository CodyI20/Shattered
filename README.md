# Shattered
This repo contains the project in Godot made during the Game Development minor at Den Haag University of Applied Sciences

It is a story-based game with puzzle elements which revolves around the main psychological horror team of a mental disorder ( Dissociative Identity Disorder )
You play as the protagonist "Nick" and you unveil the story of the abandoned amusement park where something so horrific happened, noone should ever have to witness it.

The first look at the main mechanic (Alter swap) made using a FSM (Finite State Machine)

The idea behind it is that each alter sees different things
